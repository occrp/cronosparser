# cronosparser

### Status

As of late 2020, `cronosparser` is broken in the following ways:

* `cronosparser` only ever successfully decoded around 20-30% of the
  databases we have, and only ones generated using Cronos 3.

For this issue, we'd love to receive pull requests that address
them. We don't currently have a timeline or plan to fix the issues
ourselves.

### About cronosparser

This repo contains some WIP code to reverse engineer Cronos database files
used by the Russian-language CronosPro/CronosPlus database system, as well
as a few sample databases.

### Missing functionality

* Can password protection be circumvented?
